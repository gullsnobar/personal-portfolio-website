        I’m a passionate Frontend Developer with hands-on experience building responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, and Material UI. During my Web Development Bootcamp at the Institute of Emerging Careers, I worked on real-world projects that strengthened my ability to merge design and functionality for smooth user experiences.

I enjoy transforming Figma designs into pixel-perfect, production-ready interfaces and have recently expanded my skills with Next.js and Redux Toolkit for state management. I’m confident in version control using Git & GitHub and always write clean, maintainable code.

Currently, I’m exploring backend fundamentals with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to better understand full-stack development workflows. My goal is to keep learning, take on challenging projects, and create impactful digital solutions that balance creativity and performance.
